    UUP-AUTH - Authentication stack for PHP
=============================================================================

The uup-auth package provides a library for stacking authenticators together
to support multiple authentication method in a uniform way. 

Bundled are also authenticators for performing access restriction (i.e. on 
time of day or the ip-address/hostname). All authenticators in the stack can
be set as required or sufficient to enforce logon policy (i.e. require CAS-logon
from outside of LAN while supporting Kerberos logon from inside).

    * See the example directory for working code.
    * See API docs on http://it.bmc.uu.se/andlov/php/proj/uup/uup-auth

The library is modular. The authenticators are the frontend (credentials
obtainers) that might use a validator as authentication source (for example
LDAP). The authenticator can be combined with a storage object to support
logon sessions. 

Authenticators can be used in a stack or standalone (single login method). If
configuring a stack, use one of the access classes for easy access to chains
and authenticators.
